# Performance-Evaluation-of-Antenna-in-Urban-Environments-for-Air-to-Air-Communication-Applications

Channel modeling is crucial for describing the behavior and characteristics of a communication medium or channel through which a signal propagates, gets distorted, and experiences various effects while traveling from the transmitter to the receiver. Channel modeling can be expressed in pathloss, RMS delay spread, and power delay profile, the most significant channel characteristics, which are experimented with simulations. The simulations are performed by Wireless Insite software using an urban environment including the effects of building heights, altitudes of transmitter and receiver, the distance between the transmitter and the receiver, other obstacles, and terrain. Two case scenarios have been considered: Directional Antenna and 1x8 Antenna Array.

Directional Antenna: All the parameters and simulation scenario are given below.

Antenna type:	Directional

Polarization: 	Circular

Figure above exhibits the project view of U2U communication where X and Y are two transceivers.

1x8 Antenna Array: All the parameters and simulation scenario are given below.

Antenna type:	1x8 antenna array

Polarization: Circular

Transmit power:	53.01 dBm
